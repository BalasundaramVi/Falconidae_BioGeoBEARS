# Increased Rate of Diversification of Falconidae due to Expansion to Open Habitats across the World
R project tracing the origin of Falcon species

The Falconidae are a diverse family of birds that inhabit every continent on the planet. They are a relatively young clade and only originated in South America approximately 40 million years ago (Griffiths 1999). Even though they are not a very large phylogeny, consisting of only 64 species, their patterns of diversification and geographic dispersal shed insight into the ability of caracaras and other Falcinoformes to rapidly speciate and settle into novel environments. This study aims to find the link between the geographic patterns of the Falconidae and the unique patterns of speciation and diversification that distinguish each subclade within the family. We use a Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures, analysis of the gamma statistic through a Monte Carlo Constant Rates test, and a geographical analysis of Falconidae ancestral nodes through BioGeoBEARS. Through a structured approach we aim to first establish the increase in diversification rates in Falconidae closer to the present, and then proceed to analyze some of the factors that might have caused this increase. Throughout our analysis we develop the concept of geographic radiation, which we hope will elucidate patterns of diversification amongst birds and other species with varied home regions. Most of all we present evidence rejecting the hypothesis that there is no correlation between geographic dispersal patterns and rates of diversification of the Falconidae.
